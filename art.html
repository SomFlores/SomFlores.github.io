            <img src="img/articons/doravante.gif" alt="doravante (a tribute to dorayachi)"> <br>

            doravante (en: henceforth) is a tribute to beginnings. <br>
            The beginning of my adventure in music was marked by the birth of dorayachi [ドラヤチ ] in 2010. The first
            musical project to which I dedicated myself wholeheartedly and the first band I ever played live
            with.<br>
            dorayachi was inspired by the japanese cultural scene and rock artists which brought the former members
            together in the first place.<br>
            Now, 8 years after its end, doravante is a reflection upon, a reinterpretation and a new take on the songs
            from dorayachi's never released album: TOBU [飛ぶ].<br>
            It is also a tribute to friendship.<br>
            To a band whose formation has changed so much and where some of its members got to play a musical instrument
            for the very first time and where making music was often just a great excuse to hang out. <br>
            Released March 20th, 2021 at 9:38 (GMT).<br>

            2014, I recorded a series of electric guitar works when I first decided I wanted to learn how to use a DAW.
            Each one of these songs was started and completed in a single night (while my mother was away working) and
            what remains of them today are the .mp3 files that were recorded over six years ago.

            music album. Each track lengths exactly 10 minutes, adding up to one hour of music.
            Its structure resembles that of an I Ching hexagram (六十四卦) which are composed by a top and a bottom bāguà
            (八卦), each made up of three lines.
            It is a slow reflection on a short-timed life event aided by a strict set of rules and the Conjoining ䷞
            hexagram.
            Throughout the album, the tracks become increasingly more structered, rhythmic and tonal and some are split
            into noisy and melodic parts.<br>

            <img src="img/articons/vague.gif" alt="a vague sense of presence">a vague sense of presence is a symbiosis
            between individual sounds and its encompassing aural field. Each of the composers followed the path they
            desired, culminating in a work that reflects its particularities and likenesses. By linking all the parts,
            the path converged into a single point, a center.
            As a collective, the parts make up the whole. The individuality, although present and symbolized by each one
            of the speakers, is diluted. In the implied volume created by the structure, a space of communion and
            contemplation emerges, surrounded by sound. Each composition is generative, as well as the transitions
            between themselves.
            Using a probabilistic system and the intrinsic internal compatibility of the unique elements of each
            composition, the complete work is composed. An installation by COLECTIVO 「大音量コンピューター」 (Gonçalo Santos, ギ
            (Gui), Ivo Santos, Joana Rodrigues, Tiago Aires Lêdo, Luís Arandas, Marcelo Sousa, Paulo Teixeira, Pedro
            Sarmento). A
            linear version of this work is avaliable as an album on bandcamp. <br>

            a voice message and end the transmission. The next user who picks up the phone will first listen the
            voice message left by the previous user and then have the opportunity to leave their own to the next
            user. In the end of the demonstration the integrity of the voice messages go through a speech-to-text

              <i>Music with Plants: Cultivating Bonds Between Grade-Schoolers and Nature through Sound Design</i> and it
              is being developed in collaboration and with the support of the educational service of the Orquestra Jazz
              de Matosinhos. The project was presented at the <b><i>21st Conference Consciousness Reframed 2019 —
                  Sentient States: Bio-mind and Techno-nature</i></b>.

      <p>Exercícios de Florescimento is an artistic project that seeks to hypothesize an inclusive and sustainable future. It grows from the intersection of trans and non-binary identities, willing to build and experiment with ways of renewing the anti-capitalist struggle.
        Florescimento tears through even the hardest and most stagnant material, persevering through each cycle, imagining a forest around every corner.<br>
        It took the form of two complementary exercises: first, the creation of a seed flag to be carried during the parades celebrating the Carnation Revolution until its final landing in the garden of Avenida 25 de Abril in Porto, where the seeds carried in the flag were planted; second: a performance-installation piece that took place in Armazém Pedreira on August 19, 2023.<br>
        This project was co-created by <a href="https://girlflux.xyz">Flor</a>, <a href="https://rebecaletras.online/">Rebeca Letras</a>, me and Paula Tomás Marques.<br>
        The clothing desgin and production is from Tilo (Patrícia Brito); Joana Rodrigues did the sound and light operation; the design and website development is by <a href="https://plana.digital/pt/">PLANA</a>; video by Alexandra Côrte-Real; photography by Confúcio and others; and it was made thanks to the support of Pedreira and Criatório (CMP).<br>

              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLctLgp8vas">MOÇO</a>; video that I captured during my time in

              with the same name of the presentation. (2) performance (3) found, made, unfinished and abandoned objects
              from the residency.
              In this residency I had the invaluable support of Hilda de Paulo; with the artistic production of
              Francisca Marques and Lola Rodrigues,
              the video registration of Bruno Lança, and the production and construction support of the whole Artworks
