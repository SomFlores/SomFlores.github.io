                                    Each one of these songs was started and completed in a single night (while my mother was away working) and what remains of them today are the .mp3 files that were recorded over six years ago.

                                    Its structure resembles that of an I Ching hexagram (六十四卦) which are composed by a top and a bottom bāguà (八卦), each made up of three lines.
                                    It is a slow reflection on a short-timed life event aided by a strict set of rules and the Conjoining ䷞ hexagram.
                                    Throughout the album, the tracks become increasingly more structered, rhythmic and tonal and some are split into noisy and melodic parts.<br>

                                <img src="img/articons/vague.gif" alt="a vague sense of presence">a vague sense of presence is a symbiosis between individual sounds and its encompassing aural field. Each of the composers followed the path they desired, culminating in a work that reflects its particularities and likenesses. By linking all the parts, the path converged into a single point, a center.
                                As a collective, the parts make up the whole. The individuality, although present and symbolized by each one of the speakers, is diluted. In the implied volume created by the structure, a space of communion and contemplation emerges, surrounded by sound. Each composition is generative, as well as the transitions between themselves.
                                Using a probabilistic system and the intrinsic internal compatibility of the unique elements of each composition, the complete work is composed. An installation by COLECTIVO 「大音量コンピューター」 (Gonçalo Santos, ギ (Gui), Ivo Santos, Joana Rodrigues, Lêdo, Luís Arandas, Marcelo Sousa, Paulo Teixeira, Pedro Sarmento). A linear version of this work is avaliable as an album on bandcamp. <br>
                                First presented October 36, 2018 at FESTIVAL SEMIBREVE in Braga. This work was partly supported by MM-FEUP.<br>

The users pick up the telephone and are instructed to "Please leave your message after the tone *beep*", having then a few seconds to leave a voice message and end the transmission. The next user who picks up the phone will first listen the voice message left by the previous user and then have the opportunity to leave their own to the next user. In the end of the demonstration the integrity of the voice messages go through a speech-to-text proccess and a word-cloud is generated, represented the most frequent words used in the voice messages.
