                                    <h3>estímulo.miragem</h3> is a 6 track music album. Each track lengths exactly 10 minutes, adding up to one hour of music.
                                    Its structure resembles that of an I Ching hexagram (六十四卦) which are composed by a top and a bottom bāguà (八卦), each made up of three lines.
                                    It is a slow reflection on a short-timed life event aided by a strict set of rules and the Conjoining ䷞ hexagram.
                                    Throughout the album, the tracks become increasingly more structered, rhythmic and tonal and some are split into noisy and harmonic parts.<br>

                                <!-- A VAGUE SENSE OF PRESENCE --> <div class="flex-container-content">
                                <h3>a vague sense of presence</h3> is a symbiosis between individual sounds and its encompassing aural field. Each of the composers followed the path they desired, culminating in a work that reflects its particularities and likenesses. By linking all the parts, the path converged into a single point, a center.
                                As a collective, the parts make up the whole. The individuality, although present and symbolized by each one of the speakers, is diluted. In the implied volume created by the structure, a space of communion and contemplation emerges, surrounded by sound. Each composition is generative, as well as the transitions between themselves.
                                Using a probabilistic system and the intrinsic internal compatibility of the unique elements of each composition, the complete work is composed. An installation by COLECTIVO 「大音量コンピューター」 (Gonçalo Santos, Gui, Ivo Santos, Joana Rodrigues, Lêdo, Luís Arandas, Marcelo Sousa, Paulo Teixeira, Pedro Sarmento). A linear version of this work is avaliable as an album on bandcamp. <br>
                                First presented October 36, 2018 at FESTIVAL SEMIBREVE in Braga. This work was partly supported by MM-FEUP.<br>
